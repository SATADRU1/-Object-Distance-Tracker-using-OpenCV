# -Object-Distance-Tracker-using-OpenCV
A real-time object distance tracking system built using Python and OpenCV. It detects objects based on their color and calculates the distance between them in centimeters (cm). The first detected object is automatically set as the **reference**, and all other objects are measured relative to it.
